# System Clarification: Trading Bot vs Exchange

## What This System IS

**AI-Powered Crypto Trading Bot Client**
- Connects to external cryptocurrency exchanges via CCXT library
- Processes natural language trading commands through AI
- Submits orders to exchange APIs on behalf of users
- Fetches market data from exchanges for analysis
- Manages user portfolios by tracking positions across exchanges
- Provides intelligent trading assistance and automation

## What This System IS NOT

**NOT a Cryptocurrency Exchange**
- Does NOT generate or maintain order books
- Does NOT perform order matching between buyers and sellers
- Does NOT handle custody of user funds directly
- Does NOT process deposits or withdrawals
- Does NOT provide liquidity or market making services
- Does NOT operate as a trading venue

## Key Technical Distinctions

### Trading Bot Architecture
```
User Command → AI Processing → Risk Management → Order Submission → External Exchange
                                                        ↓
                                               Order Execution on Exchange
                                                        ↓
                                               Status Update to Bot
                                                        ↓
                                               Portfolio Update & Notification
```

### Exchange Architecture (What we DON'T do)
```
Buyer Order → Order Book → Matching Engine → Trade Execution → Settlement
Seller Order →     ↑              ↓              ↓
                Order Book    Trade Engine   Clearing System
```

## Data Flow Clarification

### Market Data (Read-Only)
```
